**Project Name:** Communication Lab assignment 1: 30MFF
**Project Description:** For this project we were asked to create a website to house our 30MFF videos. For my website I wanted to incoperate the fun aspect of the video into the design of the webpages. The web page is inspireed by comic books in some aspects like the font in the button page and the solid shadows. 
the titles of the subparts of the page are inspired by the text used in the video, "this is our video", where they are vague and they state the obvious which I though was a funny aspect of the video. the eyes that appear add an element of suprise and fun to the webstite and creates a more enjoyable experience for the person watching the video. The two buttons on the side of the video incorporate some prominent audio elements from the video this adds an element of interactivity becuase each viewer has a unique watching experience. 
**Reflection/Evaluation:** I tried to stick the the initial layout, which I believe I did well. The color palette change many times in the proccess though, it started as something along the lines of:

where the colors were muted but I decided that the muted color palette does't reflect my desired design so I used brighter colors (as seen in the current website). the placement of objects and reponsivity of them was challengeing at times, but I eventully got everything to do what I wanted it to do.

Project Name
Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.
Process: How did you go about implementing the concept. One thing I still need to figure out is how to make a mobile version compatable with the appearning
Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version. I also tried using the grid to try out the inetial layout but decided to not use it now becuase I wanted to hone my basic css skills before moving on. (the images below are only placeholders)
